# Fabric-Mod-Curation

If you have a mod in mind that you'd like to recommend, don't hesitate to submit a request in the repository's 'Issues' tab. This is my curated selection of Fabric mods and macros that significantly enhance your vanilla gameplay, and they are fully compatible with multiplayer servers. These picks are well worth exploring, and I'll strive to keep the list as current as possible.

Download Fabric here: https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/
Most Fabric mods require installing the Fabric-api mod. Get it here and install into your .mods folder.

Mods list 1.20.2

Roughly Enough Items
Basically the fabric equivelant of Just Enough Items mod for Forge.
Clean and Customizable. An easy way to browse minecraft items and crafting recipes.

Sodium / Iris
A more lightweight alternative to OptiFine for Fabric that, unlike Optifine, isn't riddled with bugs and telemetry. 
Iris is the only Shaders mod I know of that doesn't screw up armor textures.

ItemLocks
A wonderful little mod that prevents you from pressing q and dropping or losing certain items from your hotbar or inventory.
This is a mod that should be included in the actual game as a feature.

Litematica
This extremely useful mod allows you to display a hologram of any schematic for easier rebuilding. You can also save your creations to schematic files and share them. There's also build assist features that let you build creations faster. It's a printer mod with extra steps

Xaeros Minimap
A very well maintained minimap / radar mod.

JourneyMap (Not 1.20.2 yet)
My personal minimap preference as it has a world map feature.

autoFish
**Warning: Some servers DO NOT allow these sort of mods, have detections & may ban for using them.**
A far more advanced auto-fishing macro that gives you something to grind wilst AFK. 
You may need to compile it for 1.20.2 as jar downloads for later versions are kinda rare.
