# Fabric-Mod-Curation

Welcome to the Fabric-Mod-Curation repository. If you have a mod in mind that you'd like to recommend, don't hesitate to submit a request in the repository's 'Issues' tab. This is my curated selection of Fabric mods and macros that significantly enhance your vanilla gameplay, and they are fully compatible with multiplayer servers. These picks are well worth exploring, and I'll strive to keep the list as current as possible.

These mods are all compatable with my vanilla Towny Earth server. **You can join and check it out at the following IP: towny.tiltedtavern.net**

## Getting Started

1. **Download Fabric**: To get started with these mods, you'll need Fabric. You can download it from the official website: [Fabric Installer](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/).

2. **Install Fabric-API**: Most Fabric mods require the Fabric API. You can get it [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and install it into your `.mods` folder.

## Mods List (for Minecraft version 1.20.2)
