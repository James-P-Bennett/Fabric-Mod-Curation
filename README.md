# Fabric-Mod-Curation

Welcome to the Fabric-Mod-Curation repository. If you have a mod in mind that you'd like to recommend, don't hesitate to submit a request in the repository's 'Issues' tab. This is my curated selection of Fabric mods and macros that significantly enhance your vanilla gameplay, and they are fully compatible with multiplayer servers. These picks are well worth exploring, and I'll strive to keep the list as current as possible.

## Getting Started

1. **Download Fabric**: To get started with these mods, you'll need Fabric. You can download it from the official website: [Fabric Installer](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/).

2. **Install Fabric-API**: Most Fabric mods require the Fabric API. You can get it [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api) and install it into your `.mods` folder.

## Mods List (for Minecraft version 1.20.2)

1. **Roughly Enough Items (REI)**  
   Basically the Fabric equivalent of the "Just Enough Items" mod for Forge. REI is clean and highly customizable, providing an easy way to browse Minecraft items and crafting recipes.

2. **Sodium / Iris**  
   Sodium is a more lightweight alternative to OptiFine for Fabric, known for being free from the issues and telemetry often associated with OptiFine. Iris, on the other hand, is a Shaders mod that doesn't disrupt armor textures.

3. **ItemLocks**  
   A wonderful mod that prevents you from accidentally dropping or losing specific items from your hotbar or inventory. It's a feature that should arguably be part of the base game.

4. **Litematica**  
   Litematica is an extremely useful mod that allows you to display a hologram of any schematic for easier rebuilding. You can save your creations to schematic files and share them, with additional build assist features to speed up your building. Think of it as a "printer mod" with extra steps.

Please note that you may need to compile it for Minecraft version 1.20.2, as jar downloads for later versions can be rare.
